# Algorithms as programming exercises

### Description

This repository is the way I found to training myself to be a programmer ever better. As a user of Github, it keeps my focus and help me to remember that write algorithms is one of the best way to improve our thinking to write good software - regardless of AI doing it much better and faster.

At least, writing computer algorithms is a good mental exercise. Maybe it is an activity that we will continue to have only for fun. Maybe won't.
