# Algorithms as programming exercises

### Author

Marcos Poletto Alves

### Description

This repository is the way I found to training myself to be a programmer ever better. As a user of Github, it keeps my focus and help me to remember that write algorithms is one of the best way to improve our thinking to write good software - regardless of AI doing it much better and faster.

At least, writing computer algorithms is a good mental exercise. Maybe it is an activity that we will continue to have only for fun.

### Algorithms

**Pascal's triangle**

* 13 lines of code in PHP (triangle.php)  
* 18 lines of code in Python (triangle.py)  

**Cody AI**

Based on the codes above, Cody AI was asked to improve the efficiency of them. See the comments inside the each code to verify its explanation. What happened seems that Cody works very well with 
Python, but not so good with PHP. Chances are that my PHP code is 
weird or confusing (it is not the case for me). At the third try it generates new part of the code was wrong and it worked (triangle_code_ai_right.php).

* wrong cody in PHP (triangle_code_ai_wrong.php)  
* wrong code in PHP (triangle_cody_ai_new_wrong.php)  
* working code in PHP (triangle_cody_ai_right.php)  
* triangle_code_ai.py  
* triangle_memo_cody_ai.py
